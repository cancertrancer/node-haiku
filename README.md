# node-haiku
First completed program - an app for Node.js that prompts the user to write a haiku line-by-line in the command line, writes it to a text file, and reads it back to the user from the file.

haikuApp is a Node.js application for the command line; these instructions are to be followed in your terminal

To use:
You must have Node installed on your computer - open your terminal and check to see if you have it installed by entering "node -v"
If you have Node installed, download the haikuApp.js file and cd into the directory in which it is stored
Initiate the program by entering "node haikuApp.js" 
You will be prompted to input your own haiku poem line-by-line; try it!
The program will write your haiku to a file called output.txt in the same directory as haikuApp.js
The program will end by reading your haiku to you from the file, and then will exit the process
Enjoy reading your haiku! Note: if you use the program more than once, the program will overwrite your haiku in output.txt each time you use it
